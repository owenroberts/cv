The City University of New York (CUNY), the world’s largest urban public university, serves over half a million students (272,000 degree students and 280,000 continuing ed/certificate students) at twenty-three colleges spread throughout the five boroughs of New York. The CUNY Academic Commons was created to respond to challenges posed by rapid enrollment growth and faculty turnover, but also to promote cohesion and collaboration around academic uses of technology. Released only a little over two years ago but already with several thousand members, the Commons has created a collaborative environment for interaction and mutual support around online and blended learning, open access publication, digital scholarship, and technology-enhanced instruction. Built on open-source software and overseen by a dedicated team of developers and facilitators, it evolves in response to its users and their interests, while helping them discover the extent to which those interests are shared, productive, and worth developing further. Its developers are now, with the support of a Sloan grant, working on the Commons In A Box – a means of replicating the project elsewhere, with maximum ease and minimum expense.
