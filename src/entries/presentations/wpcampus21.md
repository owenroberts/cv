Ten years ago, a team of faculty and technologists at New York City College of Technology, part of the 25-campus City University of New York (CUNY) system, created the OpenLab at City Tech, a WordPress and BuddyPress-based open platform for teaching, learning, and collaboration that everyone at the college can use. Since then, the OpenLab has become a vital hub of activity for the City Tech community, serving more than 36,000 members to date. We recently partnered with The Graduate Center, CUNY, to build Commons In A Box OpenLab, free and open source software that anyone can use to launch a commons for open learning. Unlike closed, proprietary systems, Commons In A Box OpenLab is designed to help students, faculty, and staff work together beyond the classroom and across institutional boundaries, sharing ideas with one another and the world.

In our presentation, we will introduce the platform, sharing example uses from City Tech's OpenLab and the Borough of Manhattan Community Collegeâ€™s installation of the software, including some of the creative ways members used its features in response to the pandemic. We will also discuss the benefits and challenges of using, building, and supporting an open platform for open learning, and the lessons we have learned along the way.
