The grant was designed to improve the number of Hispanic Students who graduate from BMCC in a STEM program and transfer to a senior college in a STEM program. A wide array of activities were conducted at BMCC, from hiring student support staff to curriculum development and from creating labs to conference and travel. In collaboration with two senior college partners, John Jay College of Criminal Justice and New York City College of Technology, articulation agreements and transfer programs and activities were developed. As Activity Directors, Professor Kok and I were responsible for overseeing all of the day-to-day activities of the project at BMCC, conducting some of the activities, as well as coordinating with the senior college partners.
