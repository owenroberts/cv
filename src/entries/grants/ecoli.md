Physical experiments with GFP and E. coli were conducted by Dr. Van Loon. Dr. Kok and I then analyzed these data to try to make a virtual model of their growing conditions and fluorescence results. We also worked to visualize the data. Other responsibilities included administrative tasks related to purchasing equipment for the grant.
