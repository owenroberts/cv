As career fields become increasingly interdisciplinary business students need to have a deep understanding of technology and students of technology need to understand business-speak. In this scenario, the need for college instruction that can go through the tight silos of a Business curriculum or a Multimedia curriculum becomes imperative. With the hope of addressing this need this grant was used to develop a course curriculum that fostered collaboration between Business students and Multimedia students and used a project-based approach that provided opportunities for active learning. The curriculum spanned two courses, one Business and one Multimedia and was designed so that students collaborated in groups in their own class and with groups in the other class on a single ‘real world’ project. The curriculum innovation called for collaboration at two levels – a within group collaboration and a between group collaboration. Students in both the Business class and the Multimedia class were divided into groups with the Business students creating the ideas and content and acting as the clients to the Multimedia students who created Web sites for the content.
