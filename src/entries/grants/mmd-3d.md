This project adapted and implemented exemplary materials and strategies from the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science at SUNY Buffalo (developing case studies for real-world multimedia projects), St. Joseph's University (PA) (adapting the Alice programming system for multimedia topics), Wake Forest University (for networked multimedia studies), and Lehman College (CUNY) (as a source for upper-division studies) to develop three gateway courses in the BMCC Multimedia Program. The project was aimed to ensure that the graduates from this program are prepared for their studies when they transfer to four-year colleges. The project is also established a Multimedia Student Access Computer Lab that will serves no fewer than 290 Multimedia Programming majors annually. A comprehensive faculty development program was implemented to ensure integration of the proposed courseware in the curriculum.
